## What is a sequence container?

It's a container, in which elements are stored exactly in the order we put them.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

Sequence containers implement data structures which can be accessed sequentially.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

## What are the differences between them?

Let's have a discussion!

Consider:

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" --> Available methods
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" --> Memory usage
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" --> Time complexity of accessing the specific element
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" --> Time complexity of searching for a matching item
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" --> Time complexity of insertion and deletion
